              <p > 3.0 Labs builds its Web3 community from a diversity of experiences, both within and outside the realm of blockchain. Passion to learn about Web3 is the only prerequisite to joining the team. Jump right into your first Web3 experience (or continue to explore) by joining 3.0 Labs, where you’ll learn about:
                <br>
                <br>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                Product and Business Management alongside some of the skills involved with creating NFTs, DAOs, Tokens or an entire Metaverse</li>  
                <br>

                <li> Combining the needs of traditional businesses with the innovations of Blockchain technologies </li>
                <br>

                <li> Leading communities and creating engaged networks of individuals </li>
                <br>
                <li> Legalities of Web3 and how to build a regulatory compliant operation within the nascent Blockchain space </li>
                <br>
                <li> Press, marketing, social media roll-out strategy for a crypto project launch </li>
                <br>
                <li> User research to understand which products and services Web3 infrastructure can offer the most value to </li>
                </ul>
              Looking for “accountability buddies” to explore Web3 together, a group of friends arranged a weekly online discussion about the new prospects blockchain had to offer. As contributors to the decentralized ecosystem of Web3, we do not believe in perfect competition. We welcomed partnerships and collaborations and worked with contributors with various schedule constraints. Within months, the group expanded exponentially as members branched out to onboard newcomers and collaborate on projects. 
              <br>
              <br>
              Emerging from this organic community, 3.O Labs represents a diversity of creatives and technologists who envision a Web3 enabled future across countless industries. Our products and services aim to capture these values and create more meaningful experiences for newcomers, veterans or part-time explorers of Web3. </p>
